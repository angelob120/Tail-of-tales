It's a tail that makes every squirrel envious. Nobody in this forest has a tail like mine!The berries there are the juiciest and most delicious you'll ever taste. I'd love to show you, but it's a bit of a trek, and I'm worried about my own tail. Would you be willing to accompany me and keep an eye out for any danger? I'm sure a squirrel as courageous as you won't have any trouble."

In their eyes, without his glorious tail, Damian was no longer the handsome squirrel he once was. His appearance had been his defining feature, and with it gone, he was scorned."

He believed that the colony should only consist of the most beautiful and perfect squirrels, and he considered Damian's current appearance unacceptable."
